Vietnamese dishes are typically prepared with fresh herbs such as cilantro, ginger, lemongrass, mint, and basil, and often served with fish sauce, shrimp paste, or soybean sauce on the side. Because Vietnamese food is cooked with minimal oil, select spices, and fresh ingredients, it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines in the world. Pho99 Nepal reflects the amazing food culture of Vietnam, which says you donâ€™t have to go looking for great food - great food finds you! You never go hungry in Vietnam. Great food is everywhere; street corners, alleyways, outdoor cafes, or served in the finest restaurants or from street food carts. Pho99 currently has three locations. One is in expat community area of Jhamsikhel, Lalitpur, another is located at prime location of Lazimpat, right across from hotel Shangri-La while the third one is situated right at Boudhnath stupa, a World Heritage Site; when you enter from the main gate of Stupa, you will find it right on your left after 5 to 6 shops.  All our locations have simple yet inviting decor awaits you - do visit us soon!",
